The salad was wonderful & Chad made sure the cucumber was removed from mine. He let us know about a great deal on an appetizer which was incredible. Now, I eat Mexican food several times each week but this Chips & Queso appetizer was surprisingly good. Chad even brought fresh jalapeños for my wife.

Now for the steaks, mine was cooked exactly as I ordered it, and my wife's was exactly how she ordered it. I can't tell you how many times I've had to send her steak back to the kitchen over the years. WELL DONE is difficult, I know, due to customers complaining about a dry steak, but hers was perfect. Cudos to the cook.

My only complaint was the BLONDIE dessert is no longer Maple-Walnut. But the new variation is still a delicious dessert.

The curbside pickup is on the west side of the building.

I was seated immediately by the hostess at a booth which I requested.
The server was friendly, polite, and professional and took my order a short while after I was seated.

When I ordered the Strawberry Margarita, I did not expect a super big one. I could actually taste the Malibu Rum in it. The picture looked refreshing and it was. The server also brought a large glass of ice water, as some margaritas can be super sweet. Although I like a more tequila in my margaritas, this was refreshing and the coconut flavor popped.

My huge Oriental Chicken Salad with crispy chicken was delicious and they didn't skimp on the dressing. It was served with a hot, buttery, herb breadstick which was a nice touch. I do miss the mandarin oranges the salad used to come with decades ago. I left with enough salad to be served as a side with another meal.

When I arrived, the restaurant was moderately full. When I left, the place was packed.

The reason I knocked a star off was that the leatherette seat of the booth was cracked and peeling and should be replaced.  And, there was something about the size of a dime and orange stuck to the table.

Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Applebee's.",--,--,home minute drive distance parking pickup side booth server order rum picture server glass ice water coconut chicken salad buttery herb breadstick touch salad decade salad side meal restaurant place reason booth size dime table dining experience,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

The Power of Customer Service (Read All for accurate review)

We arrived at Applebee's and waited to be seated, it took a bit of time, but we waited and the hostess saw us and seated us. It wasn't that busy, but for the late evening hours it was probably a lot for the number of staff on. We came in and were followed by about 4 other tables as we waited 20 minutes to be greeted and  served. Now I always try to be patient and put myself in their shoes; but as we saw not 1, not 2, but all 4 tables that came in after us be greeted and served before us. Patience was beginning to wear thin. I can understand you being busy, I can even understand not knowing who came in first when it was similar times (as the first table came in at almost the exact time), but that 4th table was in the last minute of the 20 minute wait and was greeted within 60 seconds of sitting down. So I told my husband, I need to get something out of the car and we would allow them about 2 more minutes, and to order everything if they came by. As I re-entered the restaurant, a man who I assume was the manager greeted me. I explained, I didn't need to be seated, as I was seated 20 minutes ago and waiting on a server. He promptly asked if he could be our server and did so in an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL manner.
He immediately took our entire order, got us drinks, and offered to comp the check, BUT here is the point I want to make. He did such a fantastic job, I felt no NEED for the check to be comped. So we happily paid the bill AND tipped this man. He truly deserved it. I hope Applebee's appreciates THIS man. If I owned a large company, I would want a man like this running things. I only regret not getting his name. As I am not sure if the name on my receipt is his. Poor oversight on my part. I was tired, but thanks to this man, not hungry and hunting for another place to eat!!",--,--,service review applebee bit time hostess evening hour lot number staff table minute patient shoe table patience time table time table minute minute husband car restaurant man minute order drink check point job need check company man name receipt oversight part man place,0.0,0.97,0.03,0.0772,Neutral

It was a 20 minute wait while there was visible seating, a server came after about 15 minutes to let us know her table was being cleaned. Finally the host came to seat us in another section and explained he was the only host and apologized but still no explanation of why the wait was so long to be seated. The waitress was pleasant but seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. A 5 minute wait to order drinks. Waited another 10 minutes for soggy lemons for water. The food was mediocre at best and overly salted. They also no longer have a veggie burger. We stuck to basics like classic burger, house salad, chicken tenders and Alfredo. Ordered a drink( long island) which did not come out until after the check and was made to go because the bartender ""cut himself"" and she had to find the backup bartender. This was honestly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Food definitely not photo worthy.

Edit: Returned to visit on 7/23 and could tell the difference. Staff was very friendly and was quickly informed of the wait time. Drinks and apps came so fast and the waitress Taquana was awesome!!!

Kudos for handling a miscommunication well. Upon entering we were warned of an extreme wait although many seats appeared available. However, our wait was very reasonable.

When taken to our seat, we had to wait for the table and the seats to be cleaned.

Our order was taken in a reasonable amount of time. And, the food was also delivered in a satisfactory amount of time.

The food looked good and tasted good.

Here the miscommunication began. Under the Ribs Section of the menu, they list both riblets and ribs. I ordered the smaller plate of the riblets. I know that I specifically mentioned the price and I feel sure I pointed out the item and price on the menu.

Since it's been so long since I ate at Applebee's, I didn't notice a discrepancy between what I ordered and what was delivered. The fries were very good and the meat was tender and tasty. There was some dryness in the thicker pieces of meat and the edges.

When the ticket was delivered I noticed a higher price for my meal. Looking at a menu still on the table I noticed it was the price of the small plate of ribs. After calling it to the attention of the server, she assured me that she had entered it correctly and that they would fix it.

Then a manager came out to explain that what I had eaten was the item that was charged. I continued to explain that regardless it was not the item ordered. However, I suggested that since it was what had been delivered and consumed, that we would pay the higher price.

Here the restaurant via the manager stepped up and adjusted the price to the item ordered and not the item delivered. Kudos!

So, although there were some issues, I would eat at this restaurant again. And, I would recommend it to others.",--,--,review seat seat table seat order amount time food amount time food rib plate riblet price item meat piece meat edge ticket price meal menu table price plate rib attention server manager item item price restaurant manager price item item restaurant,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral
