A guy from the group asked a waiter to “hook them up.” The waiter then took them out the front door and to the back door and sat them at a table. When we spoke with the manager who did not have a name tag on, he first refused to provide his name. He then only provided his first name, Zach and told us we don’t need his last name. We then asked for the general manager’s name and the waiter’s name and Zach replied “you’ll figure it out.” When asked why he allowed people to skip the wait list, he said they were just “Mike’s (the waiter) friends” and were not being served and  were just sitting at a table waiting for a ride (which was a lie as we saw them park and enter the restaurant). Zach refused to accept responsibility for the situation and told us we were “‘making this bigger than it is.”  It should be noted, everyone waiting was
African American and the “friends” who were allowed to skip the line, were all Caucasian. This was pointed out to Zach as well and he just shrugged his shoulders.  This is the worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant.
I seriously can’t believe the lack of professionalism and the level of discrimination   that was exercised. We obviously left prior to being seated and will never return.

Today on July 24th, we had the worst experience at Applebees on Churchmans Road in Delaware.

As a Department Manager, I truly understand the importance of customer service and delivery. Upon arriving,  the hostess greeted us with care and professionalism. However,  I can't say the same for our waitress. The waitress treated us as if we were invisible. We didn't mind her taking a bit longer to come to the table to introduce herself.

Two other parties entered and were seated near our table within 5 to 15 mins apart. Both tables were greeted in a timely manner (by the same server) and had thier orders taken. All the while, we only had drinks and kept trying to get her attention as we have been waiting to place our order. With utter frustration we collectively decided to leave. Though we paid for the drinks (via the app on the table), we were extremely taken back by the service we received or didn't receive.

We felt invisible. As if our dollars didn't matter. As if we didn't matter. It's heartbreaking to know that individuals withing companies treat customers differently (for either the color of thier skin, biasness or any other factor).  We simply wanted to enjoy each other's company and have a good ending to our long awaited date. Instead we ended the night trying to be brave and poised while trying not to be disruptive for not receiving any service.

An apology is not warranted. Nor do we want a refund for the drinks. Simple do better! No customer regardless of race, gender or background should ever leave utterly disappointed. This will be our last visit to any Applebees in any area.",--,--,today experience manager importance customer service delivery hostess care professionalism waitress bit table party table min table manner server thi order attention place order frustration drink app table service dollar company customer color thi skin biasness factor company date night refund customer race gender background visit applebee area,0.056,0.793,0.151,0.6486,Positive

We stopped at this Applebee's because it was one of the few places open on this side of town at 10pm. The service was prompt, but the food was mediocre at best. We ordered the pub pretzel appetizer, which was pretty crusty and must have been sitting around for some time. The boyfriend had the brisket tacos which he said were passable. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup which I've had often, but it was awful. I'm talking- 'I can't eat it'- horrible. I took one bite and pushed it to the edge of the table to wait for our server. When she ""checked up"" on us, she looked at my still full soup bowl as she walked past the table, asked ""how is everything"" and kept walking before I had a chance to answer. She ignored my still full soup bowl the rest of the meal. Never inquired. Never offered a replacement. Didn't offer to take it off the check. Nothing. She could not have cared less. Needless to say, we will not be back. There are too many places in this town to eat to suffer bad food and lousy service.

*Update*

The manager sent us a gift card and asked us to give them another chance, so after several months, we finally decided to give them another try. This time we went for lunch. The service was better, but my sandwich came out wrong. The boyfriend's burger was correct and he said it tasted decent.

When I paid with the gift card, the sever told us we couldn't use it because it was expired (it was not- it clearly stated the expiration date), when I showed her the date and said it was valid, she then took several minutes to confer with a manager somewhere. The server finally returned and reluctantly told us that even though it wasn't from their Applebee's (it was) and that it was expired (it wasn't) that the manager would do us a favor and take it this time.

Just go to Waffle House if it's late, or the Cracker Barrel a few doors down, if it isn't.",--,--,place side town service food time boyfriend brisket chicken tortilla soup bite edge table server soup bowl table chance answer soup bowl rest meal replacement check place town food service update card chance month time service boyfriend burger card expiration date date minute manager server manager barrel door,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.4588,Positive
