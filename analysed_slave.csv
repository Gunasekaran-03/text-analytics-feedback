The waitress was pleasant but seemed to be a bit overwhelmed. A 5 minute wait to order drinks. Waited another 10 minutes for soggy lemons for water. The food was mediocre at best and overly salted. They also no longer have a veggie burger. We stuck to basics like classic burger, house salad, chicken tenders and Alfredo. Ordered a drink( long island) which did not come out until after the check and was made to go because the bartender ""cut himself"" and she had to find the backup bartender.
